NOTE:
This file is substantially modified from the original source taken from:

Broadly speaking, the changes are:

- Refactored into multiple JS files
- Much less strict evaluation.  Allow arguments to be coerced to correct type.
- Allow arguments to be objects exposing toString() and valueOf()
- Added Math and String Operators
- camelCase functions
- Add many Level 1 Openformula functions
